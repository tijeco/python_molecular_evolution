# Module 4, Lesson 1: Dot-matrix methods

Dot plots compare two sequences by organizing one sequence on the x-axis, and another on the y-axis, of a plot. When the residues of both sequences match at the same location on the plot, a dot is drawn at the corresponding position.

```python
seq1 = ""

dot_plot(seq1,seq2)
```
