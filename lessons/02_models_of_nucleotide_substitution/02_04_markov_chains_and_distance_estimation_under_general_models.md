# Module 2, Lesson 3: Maximum likelihood estimation of distance

## Markov chains

Equation 1.57

## Distance under unrestricted (UNREST) model

Equation 1.62

Example 1.10

```python


# calculate liklihood of 12s rRNA for Unrest
```


## Distance under the general time-reversible model

Equation 1.67
Equation 1.69

May be too complicated!!!
